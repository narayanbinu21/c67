once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the bank of a river.
in the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. one daythe crocodile came to the bank of the river and
rested under the tree.
the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. the crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
